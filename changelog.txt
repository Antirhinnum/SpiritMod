- Fixed Retro + zoom issue in Ocean
- Fixed issue where quest saving/loading used a localized value, making it incompatible if you switch languages.
	Loading for legacy localized saves still works, so if you go into an existing world, you'll still have your quests.
	Saving & exiting the world will then update the save so you can switch languages freely.
- Fixed Hemophora, Festerfly, Gloop, Glitterfly and Ancient Apostle broken AI
- Reduced the amount of dust that the Two-Faced Masks's projectiles emit
