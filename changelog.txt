- Fixed Living Elderbark Wand taking 100 research
- Increased initial Frostbite mana cost to 24. 
This is so spam clicking for higher DPS is an option but isn't anywhere near sustainable;
the continuous mana usage of an existing Frostbite aura is unchanged.
- Fixed Fathomless Vases dropping a copy infinitely
- Picked open the softlock during the "Nesting eggs" generation step
- Buffed Bismite Staff (-2 use time, +3 damage, +2 shot velocity)
- Fixed Leather Striders and Heartbeat Cleats not actually applying movement buffs
- Slightly buffed both of the above (+5% max speed)
- Increased tick time for Aurora Monolith forced aurora internal timers (should fix flashing issue)
