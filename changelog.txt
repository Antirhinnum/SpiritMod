- Fixed Infernal Pact doing math wrong
- Fixed Cryolite Aura trying to apply a debuff to dummy NPC slot
- Added additional check for Glyphs that only allows their GlobalItem to be applied if it has a max stack of one
- Made the Adventurer always spawn in the top half of the Briar so he's easier to find
